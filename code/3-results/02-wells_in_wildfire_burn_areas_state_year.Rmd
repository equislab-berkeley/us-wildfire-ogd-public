# Description

These analyses are for the assessments of the number of wells in all wildfire burn areas by state and year (1984-2020). These are oil and gas wells with any operation date before the year of the wildfire and wells with missing operation dates, which we presume to have been drilled before the study period in an era of poor record-keeping. In a sensitivity analysis, we omit wells without data on operation dates.

# Aggregated results for all states

### Plot. Wells in wildfire burn areas by year

```{r echo=FALSE}
wells_wildfire_state_year %>% 
  group_by(year) %>% 
  summarize(n = sum(n_wells)) %>% 
  ggplot() +
  geom_bar(aes(year, n), stat = "identity") +
  labs(x = "Year", y = "Wells (n)") +
  theme_classic()
```

### Plot. Wells in wildfire burn areas by year with best fit line

```{r echo=FALSE}
wells_wildfire_state_year %>% 
  filter(year %in% c(1984:2019)) %>%  # omitting 2020 with incomplete fire data
  group_by(year) %>% 
  summarize(n = sum(n_wells)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(year, n)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", color = "black") +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", color = "blue", formula = y ~ poly(x, 2)) +
  labs(x = "Year", y = "Wells (n)") +
  theme_classic()
```

### Model. Wells in burn area \~ year

```{r}
model_fit <- glm(n_wells ~ year, family = "poisson",
                data = wells_wildfire_state_year)
summary(model_fit)
```

### Model. Wells in burn area \~ year \* state

```{r}
model_fit <- glm(n_wells ~ year + factor(state), family = "poisson",
                 data = wells_wildfire_state_year)
summary(model_fit)
```

In models adjusted for state, the number of wells in wildfire burn areas increased throughout the study period, 1984-2020 (p \< 0.001). Unclear if this holds up when we use a non-linear model, given peaks in the mid-2010s. Getting 2020 wildfire data would help resolve this.

## Wells within 1 km of wildfire burn areas

Fit OLS linear regression models to look at the association between n wells in burn areas and time (in years). Some notable heterogeneity among the three states with the most wells in burn areas.
