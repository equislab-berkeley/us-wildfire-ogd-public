# Wildfires increasingly threaten oil and gas wells in the western United States with disproportionate impacts on marginalized populations

This code accompanies a study that has gone through one round of peer review. Additional changes to the codebase may be necessary prior to publication.

## Study Description

In this study, we examined the intersections of wildfire, oil and gas development, and human populations, both historically and projected under future climate change. For the past decade, the United States (U.S.) has been the top global producer of crude oil and natural gas, with most production concentrated in western states, where the extent and intensity of wildfires have been worsening as climate change progresses. The impact of emerging climate-related hazards, including wildfire, on existing and future oil and gas infrastructure is of relevance to diverse stakeholders, including nearby residents and land management authorities in tribal, local, state, and federal government. Drilling is ongoing, and the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 ties renewable energy rights-of-way on federal land to new oil and gas lease auctions. In this study, from 1984â€“2019, we observed a five-fold increase in the number of wells in wildfire burn areas and a doubling of the population within 1 km of these wells. We project that these trends will increase by late century, likely threatening human health, with disproportionate impacts for Asian, Black, Hispanic, and Native American people.

## Data Sources

Publicly available raw data utilized in our analysis, along with processed data, will be made available via Dryad. The gridded population data are available from [SocScape](http://www.socscape.edu.pl/). Several datasets we utilized are not publicly available but may be available upon request for research purposes. These include [Enverus DrillingInfo](https://www.enverus.com/) and the gridded historical and projected future KBDI estimates from [Brown et al. (2021)](http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/1748-9326/aba868).
